In real-world applications, user demands for new functionalities and activities constantly evolve, requiring action recognition systems to incrementally incorporate new action classes without retraining from scratch. This class-incremental learning (CIL) paradigm is essential for enabling adaptive and scalable systems that can grow over time. However, Wi-Fi-based indoor action recognition under incremental learning faces two major challenges: catastrophic forgetting of previously learned knowledge and uncontrolled model expansion as new classes are added. To address these issues, we propose CAREC, a class-incremental framework that balances dynamic model expansion with efficient compression.

An overview of the CAREC framework. Each incremental learning session consists of two alternating phases: feature expansion and feature compression. In the expansion phase, a new backbone is trained to incorporate new classes, while in the compression phase, knowledge from multiple backbones is distilled into a compact student model. The process supports lifelong learning without growing model size.

## üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Running the Code:

1. Modify the paths in `basic_config.json` to match your system setup.
2. To **train** the model:
```bash
   python script/train_run.py
```
3. To **test** the model:

Copy the path of the trained model and specify it in `test_run.py` before running the test:

```
   test_model_list = [XXXXX]
```

```bash
   python script/test_run.py
```
